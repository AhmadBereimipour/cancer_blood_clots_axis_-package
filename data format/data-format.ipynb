    "The format of the data required for the provided codes depends on the specific machine learning task and model being used. However, generally, the data should be structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Features (X): Features are the variables or attributes used to make predictions. They are typically organized as a two-dimensional array or DataFrame, where each row represents an observation (sample) and each column represents a feature. The features should be numeric or convertible to numeric format.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Target Labels (y): Target labels are the values that the model aims to predict. For classification tasks, target labels are categorical variables representing classes or categories. For regression tasks, target labels are continuous variables. Target labels should be organized as a one-dimensional array or Series.\n",

    "In the case of multi-omics data, you'll need to carefully integrate and preprocess data from different omics layers before training the model. This might involve combining datasets, handling missing values and outliers, normalizing or scaling features within each omics layer, and potentially applying feature selection techniques to reduce dimensionality. Additionally, you may need to consider how to handle batch effects or other sources of variation between omics layers.\n",
