    "I've defined functions to compute mutual information (for GENIE3-like feature importance scores) and partial correlation (for PIDC-like feature importance scores). The infer_grn function takes gene expression data (X) and target gene expression data (y) as input, along with the method ('genie3' or 'pidc') and a threshold for identifying regulatory interactions. Depending on the specified method, it either uses GENIE3 (Random Forest-based feature importance) or PIDC (partial correlation) to infer the gene regulatory network. Finally, it combines the inferred networks by taking the union of regulatory interactions."
